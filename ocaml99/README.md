# Ninety-Nine Problems (in OCaml)

My implementation of [OCaml Exercises](https://ocaml.org/problems) from the official [OCaml website](https://ocaml.org/).
These are based on the [Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html),
which came from an older Prolog problem set.
